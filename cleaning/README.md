## Task Description

An app is used by the cleaning, service and maintenance personnel. When the app loads, the user should be able to choose if he is a maintainer, cleaner, or service person. Once selected, the app should display a list of pending tasks, rooms where guests have checked out, but which have not been cleaned yet for the cleaners, room service requests for the service personnel and maintenance requests for the maintenance people.
The users of the app should be able to change the status of the app through the interface (new, in progress, finished), and attach notes to it (Which will be visible in the desktop app).
This app can be a desktop or a web app, the only requirement is that it does NOT use the same technology as the web app or front desk app. So if the web app is Web Forms, and the desktop is windows forms, this can be WPF or Microsoft MVC or blazor or a windows universal app or a Maui app.
The requirement of a different type is obviously an artificial demand, but used here to force you to plan out a bit more of a complex solution.
